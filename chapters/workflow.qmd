# Workflow

## Development
- Python scripts
- Jupyter notebooks
- [Papermill](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for parametrized execution of notebooks

## Deployment
- Scripts / notebooks are refactored into functions that are mapped to REST API using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) 
- This service is then containerized using Docker then deployed (serverless) using Google Cloud Run
- This eases addition of new data sources and data munging code to be incorporated into the data pipeline

## Orchestration
- Currently Google Cloud Scheduler is used to refresh data sources at various intervals by calling respective Cloud Run endpoints
- Evaluating workflow tools (Prefect, Dagster) as potential replacement.
