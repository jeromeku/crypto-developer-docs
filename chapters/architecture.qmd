## Github Activity Tracker
Workflow is as follows:

### Extract
- Raw data is ingested from
    - GH Archive Github Events public BigQuery table: events are filtered for organizations and repos from Capital's cryptoecosystem tracker
    - Messari: Assets API and protocols pages contains categories and other useful labels / tags
    - Coingecko: Publicly traded token data including categories
    - DefiLlama: API (official and unofficial) has useful data on protocols, chains, categories, etc.
    - Github API: Can be used to pull additional metadata on orgs, repos, and committers

### Transform
- [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) is used to transform raw GH Archive github events to various views
    - All events details are embedded in a json blob column and relevant event info for pulls, pushes, etc. needs to be manually extracted
- Metadata including categories, tags, chains, etc. are extracted from other data sources
- Data cleaning pipeline then normalizes and merges data sources into a single table  

### Load
- Cleaned table is uploaded to BigQuery
- Cleaned / enriched data includes
    - Categories / Sub-categories: DeFi, NFT, gaming; DEX, money market, derivatives, etc.
    - Developer activity
        - Issues
            - Open / Close
            - Counts
        - Pull Requests
        - Push / Commits
        - Stars
        - Committer Stats
            - Location
            - Commit counts
        - Repo stats
            - Tags
            - Languages
            - Forks
