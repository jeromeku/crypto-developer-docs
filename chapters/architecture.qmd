## Github Activity Tracker
Workflow is as follows:

### Extract
- Raw data is ingested from
    - GH Archive Github Events public BigQuery table: events are filtered for organizations and repos from Capital's cryptoecosystem tracker
    - Messari
    - Coingecko
    - DefiLlama

### Transform
- dbt is used to transform raw GH Archive github events to various views
    - All events details are embedded in a json blob column and relevant event info for pulls, pushes, etc. needs to be manually extracted
- Metadata including categories, tags, chains, etc. are extracted from other data sources
- Data cleaning pipeline then normalizes and merges data sources into a single table  

### Load
- Cleaned table is uploaded to BigQuery

### Analytics
- Dashboard then pulls from the final cleaned table to visualize useful stats
